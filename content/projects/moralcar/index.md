A django platform that surveys users about their preference for complex accident scenarios and creates a model of their preference behavior according to different novel techniques (including genetic programming and probabilistic methods). An active ML algorithm only asks the most informative questions tailored to each specific user. Part of a larger research project into modeling decision processes surrounding dilemma situations.
